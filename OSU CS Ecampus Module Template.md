## Module _n_

### Module Overview Page

#### Module Introduction

Summarize the module, activities, how it relates to the course learning outcomes.

#### Module Learning Outcomes

Some, but not all CS courses add "Key Questions" after each MLO, to serve as a review/study aid for students. (e.g. Being able to answer these questions will prepare you to complete this week's assignment)
  
_After successful completion of this module, you should be able to do the following (in addition to answering the questions listed below):_

1. Module Learning Outcome 1
   * Key Question 1
   * Key Question 2
   * Key Question 3
2. Module Learning Outcome 2
   * Key Question 1
   * Key Question 2
   * Key Question 3
3. Module Learning Outcome 3
   * Key Question 1
   * Key Question 2
   * Key Question 3

### Explorations

The goal of an Exploration page is to interleave _learning_ and _doing_ into manageable chunks for learners. The number of exploration pages per module will vary. A template for each exploration page can be found below. List the ones you plan to use in this module here on the overview page.

_Use the pages within this module to explore the following concepts:_

* Exploration: Title 1
* Exploration: Title 2
* Exploration: Title 3

#### Task List

_Please make sure to complete the following assignments and other tasks:_

1. Complete this week's exploration pages
2. Contribute and respond to your classmates in the _Discussion Title_
3. Submit Homework Assignment: Assignment Title

### Exploration Page

#### Introduction

Introduce and discuss the topic covered in this concept exploration page - how the material will be applied, how it relates to the module and course learning outcomes, etc.

#### Topic

(duplicate the Topic as needed)

##### Subtopic 1

##### Subtopic 2

##### Subtopic 3

#### Self-Check Exercises

Insert some opportunities for active learning into each Exploration page. What can a student _do_ to ensure they are mastering the content introduced in this exploration? For CS courses, this may include a coding activity using Repl.it like algorithm tracing, finishing a partially developed function, predicting behavior of demonstration code. You could also include an ungraded quiz, a guided activity, web quest, etc.

#### Additional Resources

### Discussion

Each module should provide for some means of student-to-student and student to instructor interaction.

#### Discussion Prompt

_Please address the following questions_

1. Prompt 1
2. Prompt 2

#### Instructions for Initial Post

_Your Initial Post should be a xxxx-word, well-considered response to the question prompt. Reference course material to support your statements. Posts must ...._

_The initial post is worth XXX points_

#### Instructions for Peer Response

_For your second post, after reading your classmates initial posts, provide feedback. You will reply to at least xxxx of your classmatesâ€™ posts by building on them or introducing an additional consideration they did not mention. Use course material to support your statements._

_Your Peer Response(s) is/are worth xxxx points._

### Assessment Activities

Each module should have one or more formative assessments. How can the students demonstrate to the instructor they are mastering the module learning outcomes? This can be a homework assignment - such as a lab, coding activity, presentation assignment, etc.

#### Assignment Introduction

Summarize what this assignment is about, why it's important, and/or what MLO(s) or CLO(s) it supports.

#### Instructions

Write out specific steps required to perform and submit this assignment. Include references to relevant Canvas Exploration (content) pages with information necessary to do the assignment, for students to review.

#### Resources

Include any downloadable resources or external links a student might need to complete this assignment (optional)

1. Resource 1
2. Resource 2

#### Submission Instructions

Tell the student how to turn in the assignment (e.g., via GradeScope) and/or what format(s) to upload (e.g. PDF) on this page. Include details on instructor (or TA) expectations and when the assignment is due.

#### Grading Criteria

How many points is this assignment worth? What criteria is an instructor using to evaluate success? To ease your own grading and provide evaluation transparency - it is best to include a rubric if not using an alternative like autograding in Gradescope.

### Review

#### Key Take-Aways

_At this point, you should be able to answer all of the following questions._

_If you are unsure of any of these answers, take some time to review the course materials. Feel free to post questions into the General Q&A Discussion. Next week's lessons will be easier if you have invested in mastering this week's learning outcomes._

* Key question or concept
* Key question or concept
* Key question or concept

_Check the Explorations and Task List in the Week X - Overview to review learning materials and make sure you have completed all required activities for this week._
