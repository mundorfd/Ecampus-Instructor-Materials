# Narrated slide-based lectures

This is information that likely will be shared as part of training with the lecture team, but I like to make sure you see it before getting started.

Before you design the slide decks you will use to record your lectures, please visit the [Ecampus PowerPoint Guidelines Page](https://courses.ecampus.oregonstate.edu/tools/powerpoint/).

Use one of these PowerPoint Templates and follow the suggested “Best Practices” to ensure your lecture slides meet the required accessibility standards.

If you would like to use a different slide template, please discuss this with me before building your slides - so we can ensure accessibility. All slides should be in a 16:9 format.

## For images in your slide decks

- Identify the original source and citation information. Generally, we need to _avoid using copyrighted material_. We may be able to help you find or build alternatives.
- If you have included material that is not yours, or from a government site, it likely is copyrighted. If that is the case...
  - We can review it for Fair Use. I have written up some information on determining if content weighs in favor of Fair Use guidelines here: [Fair Use Determination – Ecampus Instructional Design Knowledge Base](https://idkb.oregonstate.education/knowledge-base/fair_use/) For each image sources we will need to document a bit of information about how it favors Fair Use. (I can set up a spreadsheet for this)
  - In order to be considered Fair Use, however,
    - We must have the original source of the image
    - It can't be from a textbook publisher or stock photo site
    - The image shouldn't be used in your lecture slides for decoration, but for an educational purpose, aligned with your course learning outcomes  
- If you would like to have the decks also embedded in your course either as a PDF or PowerPoint file, Include an alternative text definition of all images. All non-text content needs a text alternative that serves the equivalent educational purpose.
- Plan on sharing slides with me a week before your recording appointment (or DIY recording session), so I may check them against the Ecampus guidelines.

## Duration

Research indicates that students start dropping off after 6 minutes. Several short granular topic-specific videos are preferable to one very long lecture. This makes it easier for your students to absorb the material as well as juggle watching course videos with other obligations.
