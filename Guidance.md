# Ecampus Collaboration How-to

## Sharing Content

- Please consider your module template, and the weekly folders in our shared directory, your content source of record. All the materials should be in this folder and the module introduction, exploration or learning materials and assessments (discussions, exams, assignments) described in the module template. You can add supplemental files to these folders as needed, just let me know in the template what to look for.
- Avoid sending me content via email or pointing me to an old/existing course. This tends to lead to confusion and inconsistencies. Use this collaboration as an opportunity instead to rethink your design. An exception may be importing a quiz or an exam from an old course.
- Content should come in files I can edit (Markdown, Word or Google Docs rather than PDFs).
- Don't spend too much time on formatting unless it clarifies meaning. I have to reformat things to get them into your course anyway.

## Due Dates

- If you plan to use consistent due dates for assignments, discussions, etc., which I recommend, let me know at the beginning what you would like those to be. I'm happy to discuss this with you if you want to know what a typical week looks like.
- If the due dates vary week by week you will need to indicate this with the assignment/quiz/discussion descriptions.
- The only things that can be due during finals week is a final exam or a cumulative project.
